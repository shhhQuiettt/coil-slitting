## Abstract

Coil slitting is a critical process in metal processing industries, aiming to pro-
duce smaller pieces from wide metal strips efficiently. This paper leverages
the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), a robust multi-
objective optimization algorithm, to enhance the coil slitting process. Opti-
mization focuses on obtaining best-quality pieces, keeping their sizes as big as
possible, but also considering constraints such as coil width, minimum length
of the piece, and material properties. The experiments demonstrate various
solutions for different population sizes and probability mutation variables.
NSGA-II’s ability to generate a Pareto-optimal front enables the exploration
of trade-offs between competing objectives, offering decision makers a range
of optimal solutions.
